		Heavy fog covered the street while I was going back home from school. Since
		there was nobody in the street, I felt a little bit scared. I walked
		slowly because I couldn’t see the street clearly. When I passed a
		rubbish bin, someone tapped on my shoulder from behind. You couldn’t
		imagine how shocked and frightened I was at that time. I turned around
		to see who it was but I couldn’t see anybody! In fact, I saw a large
		mouse that was transparent and it said hi to me. I was speechless. I
		ran home as fast as I could. After I arrived home, I told my family
		about this incident but they didn’t believe it. I was so upset because
		they all said it was my imagination and told me not to tell lies
		again. So I went back to my bedroom and wanted to go to bed. “How are
		you doing?” said ‘someone’ that was standing on my desk. I believed
		that my face turned white at that time. I could do nothing but scream.
		Since the ghost noticed that I was afraid, it introduced itself to me
		in a soft voice. It’s name was Mickey and it died two years ago. In
		fact, it was starved to death. The reason why it followed me was that
		the smell of the hamburger in my school bag attracted it. I felt
		surprised as it looked kind.In the following days, we became friends.
		Everyone thought ghosts were terrifying, evil and ugly. However,
		Mickey was different. It was kind, interesting and cute. It gave me
		happiness and changed my life. For example, it played some tricks on
		my classmates. I loved to be with this new friend because we had a lot
		of fun. One day, heavy fog covered the street while I was walking back
		home from school again. Suddenly, someone tapped on my shoulder.
		However, this time it wasn’t Mickey. It was a robber! He asked me for
		money in a low voice. I was afraid because he was holding a knife, so
		I took out my wallet. At that moment, Mickey appeared and shouted at
		the robber. The robber felt scared and ran away quickly. How could I
		thank this kind and helpful friend for saving me? The only thing I
		could think of was saying thank you. Although Mickey was a ghost, the
		friendship between us was more meaningful than that between people.
		Mickey was the loveliest ghost I could ever fi nd.</p>
